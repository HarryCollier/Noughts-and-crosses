This file contains a noughts and crosses program written in python.

It finds the best moves using tree traversal, by creating nodes as boards with a number of actions that have been taken from the board in play, and expanding those nodes until the boards they represent have been completed.

it then compares the win loss draw stats for each set of moves by the computer, to find the best next move.
